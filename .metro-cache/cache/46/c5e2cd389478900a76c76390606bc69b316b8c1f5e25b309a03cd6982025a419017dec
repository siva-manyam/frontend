units, but are different in some languages.\n   *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n   *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n   *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n   *\n   *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n   *\n   *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n   *\n   *    `isMatch` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangeably.\n   *\n   * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n   *    the single quote characters (see below).\n   *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n   *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `isMatch` will try to match a number\n   *      as wide as the sequence\n   *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `isMatch` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n   *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n   *\n   * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n   *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n   *\n   * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n   *\n   *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n   *    |------|-----|-----|\n   *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n   *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n   *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n   *\n   *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n   *\n   *    `isMatch('50', 'yy') //=> true`\n   *\n   *    `isMatch('75', 'yy') //=> true`\n   *\n   *    while `uu` will use the year as is:\n   *\n   *    `isMatch('50', 'uu') //=> true`\n   *\n   *    `isMatch('75', 'uu') //=> true`\n   *\n   *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n   *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n   *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear](https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear)\n   *    and [setWeekYear](https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear)).\n   *\n   * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n   *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n   *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n   *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n   *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n   *    - `P`: long localized date\n   *    - `p`: long localized time\n   *\n   * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n   *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md\n   *\n   * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are often confused with days of the month.\n   *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md\n   *\n   * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n   *    on the given locale.\n   *\n   *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n   *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n   *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n   *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n   *\n   * Values will be checked in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n   * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n   *\n   * If no values of higher priority are matched (e.g. when matching string 'January 1st' without a year),\n   * the values will be taken from today's using `new Date()` date which works as a context of parsing.\n   *\n   * The result may vary by locale.\n   *\n   * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n   *\n   * @param dateStr - The date string to verify\n   * @param format - The string of tokens\n   * @param options - An object with options.\n   *   see:
